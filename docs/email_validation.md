# Email Validation in Werkudara Scraper

## Overview

The Werkudara Google Maps Scraper now includes enhanced email validation using the `email-validator` library. This feature validates the format of extracted email addresses, normalizes them to a standard form, and can optionally check if the domain actually accepts email.

## Features

### Email Validation and Normalization

The system uses the `email-validator` library to:

- Validate email format according to RFC standards
- Normalize email addresses to consistent formats
- Detect disposable/temporary email domains
- Optionally verify domain deliverability

### Implementation Details

The validation is implemented in the `_validate_email` method in the `GoogleMapsScraper` class with two levels of validation:

1. **Format Validation (`check_deliverability=False`)**
   - Checks if the email has valid format according to standards
   - Normalizes the email address (e.g., proper capitalization)
   - Detects disposable email domains
   - Does not require internet connection

2. **Deliverability Validation (`check_deliverability=True`)**
   - Performs additional DNS checks to verify the domain exists
   - Checks if the domain has valid MX records
   - More strict but may reject valid formats
   - Requires internet connection

### Output Information

When an email is validated, the following information is provided:

- **email**: The normalized email address
- **valid**: Boolean indicating whether the email is valid
- **domain**: The domain part of the email address
- **is_disposable**: Boolean indicating if it's a disposable email
- **error**: Error message if validation fails

### Integration Points

Email validation is integrated at two key points in the scraping process:

1. **Direct Extraction**: When emails are found in Google search results
2. **Website Scraping**: When emails are found on company websites

## Benefits

1. **Higher Quality Data**: Prevents invalid email formats from being stored
2. **Normalization**: Ensures consistent email format
3. **Disposable Email Detection**: Flags potentially low-quality contact information
4. **Flexible Validation**: Different validation levels for different use cases

## Technical Implementation

```python
def _validate_email(self, email, check_deliverability=False):
    """Validate and normalize an email address using email-validator library"""
    # Implementation details...
```

The method takes an email address and optional deliverability check flag, returning a dictionary with validation results.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Format Checking**: Use `check_deliverability=False` for basic format validation that doesn't require internet
2. **Full Validation**: Use `check_deliverability=True` when internet connection is available and strict validation is needed
3. **Disposable Email Detection**: Flag emails from temporary email providers to identify potential low-quality contacts

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with various email formats, including:

- Standard valid emails
- Emails with special characters
- Invalid formats
- Disposable email domains
- International domains with Unicode characters

Test results show correct detection of valid/invalid formats and proper normalization of email addresses.
